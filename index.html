                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi! My name is Hugh Pullman, this is my portfolio of projects I have been working on whilst learning to code. Having completed a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering I decided I wanted to move more into coding rather than the hardware side. I have been completing a course online to learn this.<br>Having graduated from university in June 2020 I proceeded to spend some time in lockdown earning money and then travelling the world after the global pandemic calmed down. From a military family, I have moved home location frequently and from this I have grown a love of travelling and seeing the world.<br>I am excited to enter the world or programming and look forward to my future in this career.</p>
